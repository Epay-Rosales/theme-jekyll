## Create your own shortcuts

Follow these instructions to create shortcuts in Windows explorer.

### 1. Locate folders in Windows Explorer

Familiarize yourself with the location of out-of-region folders in both M and N drives.

### 2. Navigate to folder

In M or N drive, navigate to the folder you want to create a shortcut.

```
You can't create a shortcut to files.
```

### 3. Click **Home** and then click **Pin to Quick Access**.

The folder displays under **Quick Access**. Note the pin to the right of the folder.


## Review new file

This section provides instructions for reviewing new referrals.

```
Prioritize acute referrals, then referrals with the oldest waitlist or receipt date (whichever comes first)
```

### 1. Complete the checklist

Using the checklist, go through the referral pack to ensure it's complete. Mark down missing documents and request same from referrer.

Verify waitlist date.

### 2. Evaluate referral

```
Make sure to complete the OOR template.
```

### 3. Organize file using PDF file management

Split files according to logical groups and then save in folder. Use descriptive file names.


## Send file to clerical for entry

## Complete final checks in pathways and PARIS


## Comments

The theme integrates [Commento.io](https://commento.io/) for comments below pages and posts. (This commenting service doesn't inject controversial tracking ads like Disqus does.) You will need to Commento.io account + plan ($5/month) to authorize Commento with your domain (no other configuration should be required). If you don't want comments, in the \_config.yml file, change the `comments: true` properties (under `defaults`) to `comments: false` in every instance. Then in the commento.html include file (inside \_includes), the `{% raw %}{% unless page.comments == false %} ... {% endunless %}{% endraw %}` logic will not insert the Commentio form.

## Relative links and offline viewing

This theme uses relative links throughout so that you can view the site offline and not worry about which server or directory you're hosting it. It's common with tech docs to push content to an internal server for review prior to pushing the content to an external server for publication. Because of the need for seamless transferrence from one host to another, the site has to use relative links.

To view pages locally on your machine (without the Jekyll preview server), they need to have the `.html` extension. The `permalink` property in the page's frontmatter (without surrounding slashes) is what pushes the files into the root directory when the site builds.

## Page frontmatter

When you write pages, include these same frontmatter properties with each page:

```yaml
---
title: "Some title"
tags: [sample1, sample2]
keywords: keyword1, keyword2, keyword3
last_updated: Month day, year
summary: "optional summary here"
sidebar: sidebarname
permalink: filename.html
---
```

(You will customize the values for each of these properties, of course.)

For titles, surrounding the title in quotes is optional, but if you have a colon in the title, you must surround the title with quotation marks. If you have a quotation mark inside the title, escape it first with a backlash `\`.

Values for `keywords` get populated into the metadata of the page for SEO.

Values for `tags` must be defined in your \_data/tags.yml list. You also need a corresponding tag file inside the tags folder pages/tags/ that follows the same pattern as the other tag files shown in the tags folder. (Jekyll won't auto-create these tag files.)

If you don't want the mini-TOC to show on a page (such as for the homepage or landing pages), add `toc: false` in the frontmatter.

The `permalink` value should be the same as your filename and include the ".html" file extension.

For more detail, see [Pages][mydoc_pages].

## Instructions - Where to store your documentation topics

You can store your files for each product inside subfolders following the pattern shown in the theme. For example, product1, product2, etc, can be stored in their own subfolders inside the \_pages directory. Inside \_pages, you can store your topics inside sub-subfolders or sub-sub-folders to your heart's content. When Jekyll builds your site, it will pull the topics into the root directory and use the permalink for the URL.

Note that product1, product2, and mydoc are all just sample content to demonstrate how to add multiple products into the theme. You can freely delete that content.

For more information, see [Pages][mydoc_pages] and [Posts][mydoc_posts].

## Instructions - Configure the top navigation

The top navigation bar's menu items are set through the \_data/topnav.yml file. Use the top navigation bar to provide links for navigating from one product to another, or to navigate to external resources.

For external URLs, use `external_url` in the item property, as shown in the example topnav.yml file. For internal links, use `url` the same was you do in the sidebar data files.

Note that the topnav has two sections: `topnav` and `topnav_dropdowns`. The topnav section contains single links, while the `topnav_dropdowns` section contains dropdown menus. The two sections are independent of each other.

## Instructions - Generating PDF

If you want to generate PDF, you'll need a license for [Prince XML](http://www.princexml.com/). You will also need to [install Prince](http://www.princexml.com/doc/installing/).  You can generate PDFs by product (but not for every product on the site combined together into one massive PDF). Prince will work even without a license, but it will imprint a small Prince image on the first page, and you're supposed to buy the license to use it.

If you're on Windows, install [Git Bash client](https://git-for-windows.github.io/) rather than using the default Windows command prompt.

Open up the css/printstyles.css file and customize the email address (`youremail@domain.com`) that is listed there. This email address appears in the bottom left footer of the PDF output. You'll also need to create a PDF configuration file following the examples shown in the pdfconfigs folder, and also customize some build scripts following the same pattern shown in the root: pdf-product1.sh

See the section on [Generating PDFs][mydoc_generating_pdfs] for more details about setting the theme up for this output.

## Instructions - Blogs / News

For blog posts, create your markdown files in the \_posts folder following the sample formats. Post file names always begin with the date (YYYY-MM-DD-title).

The news/news.html file displays the posts, and the news_archive.html file shows a yearly history of posts. In documentation, you might use the news to highlight product features outside of your documentation, or to provide release notes and other updates.

See [Posts][mydoc_posts] for more information.

## Instsructions - Markdown

This theme uses [kramdown markdown](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/). kramdown is similar to Github-flavored Markdown, except that when you have text that intercepts list items, the spacing of the intercepting text must align with the spacing of the first character after the space of a numbered list item. Basically, with your list item numbering, use two spaces after the dot in the number, like this:

```
1.  First item
2.  Second item
3.  Third item
```

When you want to insert paragraphs, notes, code snippets, or other matter in between the list items, use four spaces to indent. The four spaces will line up with the first letter of the list item (the <b>F</b>irst or <b>S</b>econd or <b>T</b>hird).

```
1.  First item

    ```
    alert("hello");
    ```

2.  Second item

    Some pig!

3.  Third item
```

See the topics under "Formatting" in the sidebar for more information.

## Automated links

If you want to use an automated system for managing links, see [Automated Links][mydoc_hyperlinks.html#automatedlinks]. This approach automatically creates a list of Markdown references to simplify linking.

The content here is just a getting started guide only. For other details in working with the theme, see the various sections in the sidebar.
